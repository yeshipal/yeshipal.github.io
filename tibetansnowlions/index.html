      <p>With the increasing presence of technology in today's society, the necessity to understand them and their language grows. This program provides Tibetan youth with the chance to understand, explore, and engage in what may end up to be a future career path, hobby, or skill. With computer science's fast advancements, the possibilities with what can be done with it are endless. Within the Tibetan community, CS can be used as a way to create accessible Tibetan language learning sites, promoting the Tibetan language and working to preserve the Tibetan language and culture.  </p>

Most (if not all) projects were related to components of Tibetan culture with the purpose of educating others. In the process of forming an idea for their projects, students thought of different components and all based their projects on a different aspect of Tibetan culture. They thought divergently as some students focused on written language, dance, clothing,stories, and more.   </p>

In life, different events that have impacted us developes our identity and our sense of self. Being surrounded by many others who look similar, speak the same language, and engage in the same practices provides a comfortable space where we can freely express ourselves. Through the Tibetan guest speakers, we learned the values of being a Tibetan and what it means to be a Tibetan. Acknowledging the importance of knowing/learning about our cultural background and the language is taking a step forward in strengthening one's connection with their identity. </p>

They are given the time to learn and explore all the possibilities that programming has to offer. Towards the end of every class, students are exposed to website building through apps such as Sublime Script. Using these scripts students manipulate components of a website. These hands on projects and assignments have been a great help to better students programming </p>
